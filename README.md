# mission-murder


Rules: The game is to be played on events like a weekend with friends or for example in a schoolclass. The mission is to "kill" all other players and not get "killed". You "kill" someone by handing the a predifined item like a keychan or a toothbrush. If the item is accepted the person is dead and has to give the murder the name of the own target. 

Example: 

Maria -> John

John -> Mohammed

Mohammed -> Anna

Anna -> Maria

-> means "has to kill".

If John "kills" Mohammed, Mohammed is Game Over. John now has to "kill" Anna.
